   On Debian and other systems that use the apt package manager, such as Ubuntu,
   components of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 13 can only be installed
   together with the server shipped by Percona (percona-postgresql-13). If you
   wish to use Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL, uninstall the PostgreSQL
   package provided by your distribution (postgresql-13) and then install the
   chosen components from Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL.
